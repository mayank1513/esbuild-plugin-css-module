This is a template created based on official starter Turborepo.

Simply click on `Use this template` button to use and customize this template for your next JavaSctipt / TypeScript / React / Vue / Next.js library or project.

## What's different from scaffolding turbo-repo by `create-turbo`

The default scafold from `create-turbo` just gives some stubs for sharing packages across projects/apps within current monorepo.

This template is targeted for sharing packages across organizations/repos publically or privately.

Following features make it really cool and useful

- Unit tests with `vitest`
- Build setup with `tsup` and `esbuild-react18-useclient` Supports React Server components out of the box
- **Automatic file generation**
  - just run `yarn turbo gen` and follow the propts to auto generate your new component with test file and dependency linking
  - follow best practices automatically
- github actions/workflows to auto publish your package when version changes
